## üî¨ Scientific Innovations

### Discontinuous Learning

Traditional neural networks adapt through gradual weight updates. TE-AI enables:

- Discrete architectural jumps
- Rapid escape from local optima
- Emergent discovery of novel topologies

### Stress-Responsive Evolution

```
P(transpose) = base_rate √ó (1 + stress √ó multiplier)
```

- Low stress ‚Üí stability
- High stress ‚Üí rapid evolution
- Automatic exploration/exploitation balance

### Epigenetic Inheritance

- Methylation-like markers persist across generations
- Environmental adaptations without genetic changes
- Lamarckian evolution in neural networks
