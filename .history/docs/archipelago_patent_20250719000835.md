New Method Claims:

    "A method for multi-objective optimization in an evolutionary neural network system, comprising: instantiating a plurality of isolated populations ('islands'); assigning a unique fitness function to each island, wherein each function prioritizes a different performance objective; and evolving said islands in parallel."

    "The method of claim [X], further comprising a breeding event, wherein: the best-performing individual ('champion') is selected from each of two or more islands based on their unique fitness criteria; and a new individual ('offspring') is created by combining the genetic material of said champions."

    "The method of claim [Y], wherein said offspring is injected into a third island, thereby introducing genetic material optimized for multiple objectives into a new population."

    "A method for preserving elite individuals, comprising: maintaining a 'Hall of Fame' for each island that stores the individual with the highest-ever recorded fitness; and exempting said individual from the standard selection and replacement process of the evolutionary algorithm."

New System Claims:

    "A self-modifying neural network system comprising an 'Archipelago' of a plurality of island populations, wherein each island is configured with a distinct fitness objective, and a 'Breeding Summit' controller configured to periodically synthesize new individuals from the champions of said islands."
