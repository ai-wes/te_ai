## TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT NEURAL ARCHITECTURE WITH CONTINUOUS-DEPTH MODULES AND STRESS-RESPONSIVE STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION

### FIELD OF THE INVENTION

\[0001] This invention pertains to artificial neural networks and machine learning systems. It provides a self-modifying neural architecture inspired by biological transposable elements. The architecture features continuous‑depth neural modules that autonomously reorganize their structure in response to quantified environmental stress, applicable to adaptive computing, drug discovery, cybersecurity, financial modeling, robotics, and personalized medicine.

### BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

\[0002] Traditional neural networks adapt by updating weights within a fixed topology, making them vulnerable to sudden distribution shifts, adversarial inputs, and novel problem domains. Such networks often require retraining or manual redesign when encountering new conditions, incurring significant downtime and resource costs.

\[0003] Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques automate topology design but operate offline and yield static models unsuited for dynamic environments. Evolutionary methods such as NEAT evolve architectures between generations, yet cannot restructure a deployed model in real time.

\[0004] In biology, transposable elements (“jumping genes”) drive rapid adaptation by relocating, duplicating, inverting, or silencing genetic sequences. The immune system’s V(D)J recombination exemplifies this punctuated evolution, generating extensive antibody diversity under stress.

\[0005] Prior work introduced transposition-like operators in genetic algorithms and horizontal gene transfer in evolutionary computation. However, no neural network system exists that integrates these mechanisms for on‑the‑fly structural modification during network operation.

\[0006] Accordingly, there is a need for a neural architecture capable of discontinuous, autonomous structural adaptation—preserving learned knowledge while rapidly evolving its topology in response to performance-driven stress.

### SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

\[0007] The invention delivers a neural network architecture comprising **transposable neural modules** that can relocate, duplicate, invert, or deactivate based on a measured stress metric. The key innovations are:

1. **Continuous‑Depth Neural Modules**—each module implements a neural ODE solver, allowing learnable, input‑adaptive computational depth without fixed layer counts.

2. **Stress‑Responsive Transposition**—a real‑time stress metric triggers structural mutations. Under high stress, modules relocate in the network, replicate with variation, reverse their output polarity, or become dormant.

3. **Genomic Position Encoding**—modules carry a continuous position index influencing their functional role, enabling systematic specialization (e.g., early‑stage feature extraction vs. late‑stage decision making).

4. **Epigenetic Regulation**—learnable methylation and histone‑mark parameters gate each module’s expression without altering its core weights, providing reversible activation and silencing.

5. **Population‑Based Evolution with Horizontal Transfer**—multiple network instances evolve in parallel, sharing high‑performing modules directly, accelerating cross‑pollination of innovations.

6. **Dream Consolidation Learning**—a generative replay engine synthesizes training data offline via a variational autoencoder, reinforcing memory and bolstering robustness against forgetting.

7. **Self‑Modifying Architecture Controller**—a meta‑learning component monitors performance and gradient dynamics to determine when and how to adjust the network’s structure.

\[0008] This integrated system achieves rapid, discontinuous adaptation—reported as 10–100× faster than fixed architectures—while preserving stability and knowledge retention.

### DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

#### I. Core Configuration Framework

A centralized configuration system manages all algorithmic parameters, including ODE solver settings (solver type, tolerance), transposition thresholds (base probabilities, stress multipliers), epigenetic modulation rates, population‑evolution controls (instance count, transfer intervals), and hardware optimization parameters (batch sizes, parallelization).

#### II. Continuous‑Depth Neural Modules

Each transposable module embeds a graph‑convolutional neural ODE block. Residual graph convolution layers with layer normalization and internal gating allow flexible, learnable integration depth. The ODE solver adaptively selects evaluation steps per input, balancing computational cost against accuracy. Memory‑efficient backpropagation uses the adjoint sensitivity method.

#### III. Stress‑Responsive Transposition Mechanisms

A **stress metric** combines prediction error, trend analysis of performance over time, and entropy‑based diversity measures. When the metric exceeds a configurable threshold, modules undergo one of four structural mutations:

- **Relocation**—the module’s position index changes, and its connections are rewired to neighbors consistent with the new position range.
- **Duplication**—a copy is inserted at a new position, inheriting up to 90% of parent parameters; the copy’s ODE depth parameter is perturbed by a log‑normal factor proportional to stress.
- **Inversion**—the module’s output signals are sign‑inverted and at least one histone‑mark bit toggles, reversing its functional polarity.
- **Deactivation**—the module’s chromatin‑accessibility scalar sets to zero, silencing its computations until reactivated.

All mutation probabilities scale with the stress metric, ensuring more aggressive restructuring under higher adversity.

#### IV. Epigenetic Regulation System

Modules maintain **methylation** scalars and **histone‑mark** vectors that determine chromatin accessibility. A differentiable gating function multiplies each module’s raw ODE output by an accessibility factor derived from these parameters. Epigenetic states update dynamically in response to stress, enabling reversible activation or silencing without weight changes.

#### V. Population‑Based Evolution and Horizontal Transfer

The system can instantiate multiple network clones on parallel compute units. At configured intervals, a **horizontal-transfer event** selects top‑performing modules from one instance and copies them—without gradient fine‑tuning—into an inactive region of a recipient instance. Transfer probabilities and retention rates are programmable, modeling biological plasmid stability.

#### VI. Dream Consolidation Engine

During off‑line phases, a variational autoencoder trained on stored episodic memory synthesizes new input samples. A recurrent network processes generated sequences for adversarial “nightmare” scenarios. The system replays these synthetic samples—without performing structural mutations—to consolidate parameter updates and prevent catastrophic forgetting.

#### VII. Self‑Modifying Architecture Controller

A meta‑controller monitors performance trends, gradient health (vanishing/exploding detection), and eigenvalue‑based phase‑transition indicators. Based on these signals, it issues commands to add layers, remove underperforming modules, rewire connections, adjust module dimensions, or switch activation primitives. Exploration policies use temperature‑controlled softmax sampling over candidate modifications.
