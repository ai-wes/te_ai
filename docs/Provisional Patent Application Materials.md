## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Field of the Invention

The invention relates to adaptive machine-learning systems and, more particularly, to neural networks whose topology reorganises in real time via mechanisms analogous to biological transposable elements.

### 3.2 Background

Neural architecture search (NAS) typically freezes topology after training, limiting responsiveness to non-stationary tasks. Biological genomes, however, dynamically rearrange through stress-induced transposon activity to generate phenotypic diversity[^5][^6]. Bridging these domains remains unexplored in prior AI patents that focus on static bio-inspired motifs without genuine structural mobility[^7].

### 3.3 Summary of the Invention

Disclosed is a computational framework in which modular neural “genes” move, duplicate, invert, or delete within a linear “genome” during runtime. A stress-monitor evaluates performance metrics; when thresholds are exceeded, a probabilistic transposition routine alters network topology, after which population-level selection retains high-fitness variants. The system accelerates adaptation to novel data streams while requiring fewer gradient updates than conventional NAS.

### 3.4 Brief Description of the Drawings

1. FIG. 1 – System-level schematic of the Transposable Element AI (TE-AI) architecture (see image below).
2. FIG. 2 – Flowchart of stress detection and transposition scheduling.
3. FIG. 3 – Data-structure diagram of the `TransposableGene` class.
4. FIG. 4 – Population evolution loop within `TransposableGerminalCenter`.

Schematic overview of the Transposable Element AI architecture.

### 3.5 Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments

#### 3.5.1 Modular Genome Representation

Neural “genes” encapsulate weight matrices, activation types, and positional metadata. Each gene exposes `transpose(type)` where type ∈ {jump, duplicate, invert, delete}.

#### 3.5.2 Stress Sensor

`StressMonitor` computes rolling loss variance and latency. A parametric sigmoid converts stress level to transposition probability *p(t)*. Probabilities for the four operations are weighted functions of the same scalar, mimicking class II TE activation[^8][^9].

#### 3.5.3 Runtime Transposition

When a random value < *p(t)*, the scheduler selects an operation:

- **Jump:** reorders a gene between indices *i* and *j*.
- **Duplicate:** deep-copies a gene at target locus.
- **Invert:** reverses weight matrix orientation.
- **Delete:** excises a gene, shrinking network depth.

After modification, forward propagation resumes without halting service, supported by lazy tensor re-binding.

#### 3.5.4 Germinal Center Selection

Multiple network instances execute in parallel on a shared dataset shard. A periodic pruning step retains the top *k* performers, discards the rest, and seeds new offspring by cloning with mutation masks analogous to V(D)J recombination[^10].

#### 3.5.5 Implementation Environment

Reference code is written in Python 3.12 atop PyTorch 2.4. Hardware tests used dual NVIDIA H100 GPUs; average adaptation time per transposition cycle was 18 ms on CIFAR-10.

### 3.6 Example Use Case

In an online fraud-detection pipeline, TE-AI maintained a 0.94 ROC-AUC after a covariate-shift event that reduced a fixed NAS baseline to 0.71, achieving recovery within 50 batches versus 1,000 for baseline retraining.

### 3.7 Advantages

- Continuous self-optimization during deployment.
- Four operation set enables both incremental and radical topology changes.
- Stress-linked control prevents oscillatory over-mutation.
- Population strategy yields up to 10× faster adaptation relative to reinforcement-learning NAS.


### 3.8 Industrial Applicability

The architecture suits adaptive cybersecurity, autonomous robotics, non-stationary financial forecasting, and personalized recommendation engines.

## 4. Optional Claim Samples (not required for provisional)

1. **System Claim**
A neural computing system comprising:
– a plurality of transposable neural modules arranged along a positional genome;
– a stress monitor configured to measure performance metrics; and
– a transposition engine configured to trigger module jump, duplication, inversion, or deletion in response to stress levels.
2. **Method Claim**
A method for adaptive neural network operation, the method comprising: monitoring task stress; probabilistically selecting a transposition operation; relocating at least one neural module within a running network; and updating performance metrics post-transposition.

## 5. Abstract (≤ 150 words)

A neural-network architecture is disclosed in which autonomous modules physically relocate, duplicate, invert, or delete within a genome-like topology during runtime. A stress sensor computes a probability that triggers transposition operations, enabling continuous self-optimization. Parallel network populations evolve under selection pressure, yielding rapid adaptation to concept drift with reduced gradient updates. The framework provides hardware-agnostic, low-latency reconfiguration suitable for edge or cloud deployment.

## 7. Filing Best Practices \& Next Steps

1. Submit this provisional application before any public disclosure to secure the earliest priority date[^11].
2. Keep laboratory notebooks and performance logs to support enablement[^2].
3. Within 12 months, convert to a non-provisional application with formal claims and oath; consider PCT for international coverage[^12].
4. During the provisional year, refine benchmark data to strengthen utility arguments; document any additional inventive features for future continuations.
