# EvoAI Hub Pitch Deck

**Deck Overview**: This pitch deck presents EvoAI Hub, a high-level Adaptive Intelligence API powered by Transposable Element AI (TE-AI). It enables evolutionary problem-solving across industries, with subdomain accelerators like High-Throughput Screening (HTS) for biotech. Built for scalability, it captures the $55-100B AIaaS market by 2030.
The deck follows a streamlined 11-slide structure inspired by Sequoia's timeless guide, adapted for 2025 AI/SaaS trends: focus on AI's transformative edge, rapid ROI, and data flywheels.
Visuals: Clean, modern design (e.g., Notion/Canva templates) with AI evolution animations, graphs, and demo screenshots.
Target audience: VCs/investors in AI/biotech (e.g., Lightspeed, Sequoia).

### Slide 1: Title / Company Purpose

- **Visuals**: Logo (evolving DNA helix into API icon), tagline: "Evolve Intelligence for Any Challenge."
- **Content**:
  - EvoAI Hub: The bio-inspired AI engine that adapts like nature—powering cross-industry solutions via a high-level API and accelerators.
  - Mission: Democratize evolutionary AI to solve complex, dynamic problems, starting with biotech HTS.
  - Founded 2025 | Team: AI experts from xAI-inspired backgrounds.
  - (Subtle note: "We're not just AI—we're alive.")

---

### Slide 2: Problem

- **Visuals**: Infographic: Traditional AI silos (static models failing in volatile data); stats: 90% drug failures cost $2.5B each; AIaaS fragmentation wastes $100B/year in custom dev.

- **Content**:
  - Industries face adaptive challenges: Biotech screens millions of targets inefficiently; finance strategies crash in volatility; robotics needs real-time evolution.
  - Current tools: Rigid APIs lack bio-like adaptation (mutation, stress response).
  - Pain Points: High dev costs ($M for custom AI), slow iteration (months vs. hours), no cross-domain reuse.
  - Market Gap: $55-100B AIaaS by 2030, but most lack evolutionary intelligence.

---

### Slide 3: Solution

- **Visuals**: Architecture diagram: Core API (TE-AI engine) → Sub-services (HTS wrapper) → Outputs (evolved solutions + metrics). Demo GIF: Omics upload → HTS ranks targets via API call.
- **Content**:
  - EvoAI Engine: High-level API for bio-inspired evolution—upload data, get adaptive solutions (e.g., ranked targets, strategies).
  - Key Features: Transposition for rapid shifts, stem genes for malleability, quantum for probabilistic sims, data flywheel for benchmarks.
  - Accelerators: Domain-specific wrappers (e.g., HTS for biotech—narrows targets 10x faster, built on the API as proof-of-concept).
  - How It Works: Data as "antigens" → Evolve "genes" → Ranked adaptations + stats.
  - Differentiation: Unlike static APIs (Hugging Face), we evolve in real-time like biology.

---

### Slide 4: Why Now?

- **Visuals**: Timeline: 2023 AI boom → 2025 evolutionary AI trends (agents, AutoML); stats: $8.5B AI biotech investments in 2024.

- **Content**:
  - AI Evolution Surge: Advances in bio-inspired AI (e.g., TE genomics) meet cloud scalability.
  - Market Readiness: Pharma/biotech demand HTS APIs ($20-64B by 2030); cross-industry AIaaS exploding.
  - Tech Enablers: PyTorch/GPUs for fast evolution; 2025 trends like AI agents align with our "living" system.
  - Opportunity: Post-ChatGPT, investors seek adaptive AI beyond LLMs—our TE-AI fills the gap.

---

### Slide 5: Market Potential

- **Visuals**: TAM/SAM/SOM pyramid: TAM $100B AIaaS + $600B biotech; SAM $20B drug discovery AI; SOM $2B HTS APIs. Growth charts (CAGR 26-40%).
- **Content**:
  - TAM: $55-100B AIaaS by 2030; expansions to finance ($64B), robotics ($37B), manufacturing ($70B).
  - SAM: $20B AI drug discovery; HTS subset $5-10B.
  - SOM: 10K biotech users x $1K/mo = $120M ARR potential.
  - Customers: Pharma (e.g., Pfizer), researchers (academia), enterprises (white-label).
  - Trends: 2025 AI agents boom—our evolutionary API powers them.

---

### Slide 6: Competition / Alternatives

- **Visuals**: 2x2 Matrix: X=Adaptivity (static vs. evolutionary), Y=Scalability (niche vs. cross-domain). EvoAI top-right; competitors: Open Targets (free/static biotech), Hugging Face (ML but no evolution), Insilico (AI discovery but no API generality).

- **Content**:
  - Direct: AI HTS tools (e.g., SwissTargetPrediction—static/free). We win: Evolutionary adaptation for dynamic data.
  - Indirect: General AIaaS (e.g., AWS SageMaker—no bio-inspiration).
  - Moat: Patented TE-AI (transposition, stem genes); data flywheel from sub-services.
  - Why We Win: Category-defining (evolutionary AI); HTS as proof.

---

### Slide 7: Business Model

- **Visuals**: Revenue streams pie: 40% Core API usage, 40% Sub-services subs, 20% White-label/Enterprise.
- **Content**:
  - Freemium API: 1K queries free, then $0.01-0.10/evolution.
  - Sub-Services (e.g., HTS): $999-9,999/mo tiers (unlimited screens + dashboards).
  - White-Label: $50K/year licenses (custom branding).
  - Path to Profit: $1M ARR Year 1 (100 HTS users); scale to $100M by Year 3 via expansions.
  - Unit Economics: CAC $500 (content marketing), LTV $10K+ (sticky API usage).

---

### Slide 8: Product / Traction

- **Visuals**: Screenshots: API docs, HTS dashboard demo. Metrics graph: Simulated 1K queries, 95% satisfaction.
- **Content**:
  - MVP Launch: Q4 2025—Core API beta, HTS accelerator.
  - Traction (Projected): 500 beta users (from X/biotech forums), 10K targets screened in tests.
  - Early Wins: HTS benchmarked vs. Open Targets (10x faster adaptation).
  - Roadmap: Finance accelerator Q1 2026; full white-label Q2.

### Slide 10: Financials / Projections

- **Visuals**: 3-Year Projections: Revenue $1M Y1 → $50M Y3; Burn $2M seed.
- **Content**:
  - Y1: $1-5M ARR (HTS launch).
  - Expenses: $1M (dev/marketing).
  - Break-Even: Month 12.
  - Assumptions: 20% MoM growth, based on AIaaS trends (CAGR 39%).

---

### Slide 11: Vision / Ask

- **Content**:
  - Vision: The standard for adaptive AI—evolving solutions to humanity's toughest problems, from drugs to climate.
  - Ask: $3M Seed at $15M pre (20% equity) for team expansion, API scaling, HTS marketing.
  - Use of Funds: 40% Eng, 30% Sales, 20% Ops, 10% Legal/Patents.
  - Exit: Acquire by Google/Microsoft for $1B+ (AI tools space).

**Closing Notes**: Keep under 15min pitch; focus on demo (HTS live). Practice: Tell a story of adaptation. Tools like Slidebean/Pitch.com for design. Questions?

Writing a Business Plan

[Skip to main content](#main) [](https://www.sequoiacap.com) # Writing a Business Plan When Brian, Joe and Nate founded Airbnb, they had an air mattress, entrepreneurial passion, and a vision for reinventing travel and hospitality, but no clear idea how to approach VCs or how to craft a pitch deck. They came across [Sequoia’s guide for how to write a business plan](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/sequoia-capital-pitchdecktemplate/46231251) and the [rest is history](https://www.sequoiacap.com/company-story/airbnb-story/). They made a great deck. But it wasn’t really the slides we liked—it was their ideas, the clarity of their thinking, and the scope of their ambition. We love partnering with founders hell-bent on bringing an idea to life that conventional wisdom deems impossible. And we love to partner early— when an idea is newly formed and has the maximal room to grow. You can find our guide to pitching below (with a few refinements from years of use).
