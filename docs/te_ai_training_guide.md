# Transposable Element AI Training Guide

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### 1. **Mean Fitness (Target: 0.7-0.9)**
```
Mean fitness: 0.8250  ‚Üê GOOD (High baseline fitness)
Mean fitness: 0.7899  ‚Üê OK (Slight drop is normal early on)
```

- **Good**: Steady or increasing fitness, especially after stress events
- **Bad**: Continuous decline or stuck below 0.5
- **What it means**: How well the population recognizes antigens

### 2. **Population Stress (0.0-1.0)**
```
Population stress: 0.0000  ‚Üê Currently no stress (pre-mutation)
```

- **Expected Pattern**:
  - 0.0-0.3: Normal evolution
  - 0.3-0.7: Mild stress, increased transposition
  - 0.7-1.0: High stress, transposition cascade

### 3. **Population Size**
```
Population after selection: 175 ‚Üí 305 ‚Üí 531  ‚Üê GOOD (Healthy growth)
```

- **Good**: Controlled growth (100-5000)
- **Bad**: Explosion beyond max_population or crash to <50
- **What it means**: Diversity and adaptation capacity

## Transposition Events to Watch

### Good Patterns üü¢

1. **Diverse Transposition Types**
   ```
   ü¶ò Gene jumped     ‚Üê Exploration
   üß¨ Gene duplicated ‚Üê Creating variants
   üîÑ Gene inverted   ‚Üê Trying opposites
   ```
   You want to see all types, not just one.

2. **Position-Based Specialization**
   ```
   V genes: 0.0-0.3   (early position)
   D genes: 0.3-0.6   (middle position)
   J genes: 0.6-1.0   (late position)
   ```
   Genes should mostly stay in their zones but occasionally explore.

3. **Stress-Responsive Bursts**
   ```
   Generation 50: 2-3 transpositions    ‚Üê Normal
   üö® VIRUS MUTATED!
   Generation 51: 15-20 transpositions  ‚Üê Good response!
   ```

### Warning Signs üî¥

1. **Excessive Deletions**
   ```
   ‚ùå Gene deleted (silenced)
   ‚ùå Gene deleted (silenced)
   ‚ùå Gene deleted (silenced)  ‚Üê Too many!
   ```
   Some deletion is normal, but >30% indicates problems.

2. **No Transpositions During Stress**
   ```
   üö® VIRUS MUTATED!
   Generation X: 0 transpositions  ‚Üê BAD! System not responding
   ```

3. **Position Chaos**
   ```
   V gene at position 0.95  ‚Üê V genes shouldn't be this late
   J gene at position 0.05  ‚Üê J genes shouldn't be this early
   ```

## Training Phases to Expect

### Phase 1: Initial Adaptation (Gen 1-50)
- **Fitness**: May drop slightly as system explores
- **Transpositions**: Low rate (1-5 per generation)
- **Population**: Steady growth
- **What's happening**: Building baseline diversity

### Phase 2: First Viral Mutation (Gen 50)
```
üö® VIRUS MUTATED TO Alpha Variant! Sites: [5]
```
- **Fitness**: Should drop sharply (0.8 ‚Üí 0.4-0.5)
- **Stress**: Spikes to 0.8-1.0
- **Transpositions**: Burst of activity (10-30 events)
- **Good sign**: Fitness recovers within 10-20 generations

### Phase 3: Subsequent Mutations
Each mutation should show:
1. Initial fitness drop (smaller each time)
2. Stress spike (may be lower)
3. Transposition burst (more targeted)
4. Faster recovery (5-10 generations)

### Phase 4: Escape Variant (Gen 250+)
```
üö® VIRUS MUTATED TO Hypothetical Escape Variant! Sites: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18]
```
- **Success Indicator**: System maintains >0.6 fitness despite massive mutation

## Key Performance Indicators

### üéØ **Adaptation Speed**
```python
Good: Fitness recovery in <20 generations
Bad:  Fitness still low after 50 generations
```

### üéØ **Transposition Efficiency**
```python
Good: Stress ‚Üí Burst ‚Üí Quick stabilization
Bad:  Constant high transposition (thrashing)
```

### üéØ **Diversity Maintenance**
```python
Good: 50-200 unique gene configurations
Bad:  <10 variants (convergence) or >1000 (chaos)
```

### üéØ **Module Families**
Look for emergence of gene families:
```
V12 ‚Üí V12-copy1 ‚Üí V12-copy1-mut3  ‚Üê Gene family tree
```

## Optimization Targets

1. **Primary Goal**: Maintain fitness >0.7 across all viral variants
2. **Secondary Goal**: Minimize time to recover from mutations
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Develop reusable gene modules

## Live Monitoring Commands

Add these to your code for better insights:

```python
# After each generation
print(f"Active genes per cell: {np.mean([len([g for g in cell.genes if g.is_active]) for cell in center.population.values()]):.1f}")
print(f"Unique gene families: {len(set([g.gene_type + str(g.variant_id) for cell in center.population.values() for g in cell.genes]))}")
```

## Red Flags üö©

1. **Fitness Collapse**: Never recovers above 0.5
2. **Population Crash**: <50 cells remaining
3. **Transposition Freeze**: No events during high stress
4. **Memory Explosion**: >20 genes per cell
5. **Premature Convergence**: All cells identical

## What Your Current Output Shows

Looking at your output:
```
Generation 1-4:
‚úÖ Good fitness (0.79-0.82)
‚úÖ Healthy population growth
‚úÖ Diverse transposition types
‚ö†Ô∏è No stress yet (waiting for virus)
```

You're in the **baseline building phase** - this looks perfectly normal! The system is:
- Exploring the solution space (jumps)
- Pruning ineffective genes (deletions)  
- Starting to create variants (duplication)

**Next milestone**: Watch for the first viral mutation around generation 50. You should see stress spike and a transposition cascade.




‚úÖ Good Signs:

Fitness 0.82 ‚Üí 0.79 - Small drop is normal during exploration
Population growth 100 ‚Üí 531 - Healthy exponential growth
Mixed transposition types - Jumps, deletions, and duplication show system is exploring
Gene positions are moving - System is actively reorganizing

üìç Current Phase:
You're in the "Baseline Diversity Building" phase (Generation 1-50). The system is:

Learning the base antigen pattern
Building a diverse gene pool
Establishing position preferences

üéØ What to Watch For Next:

Around Generation 50 - First virus mutation
