# TE-AI Cybersecurity Implementation

## Overview

The TE-AI Cybersecurity system demonstrates how transposable neural elements can be applied to adaptive cyber defense. The system evolves its defensive capabilities in real-time as it encounters new threats, similar to how biological immune systems adapt to pathogens.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Layer Defense Architecture
- **Anomaly Detection**: Autoencoder-based detection of unusual patterns
- **Signature Matching**: Pattern recognition for known threats
- **Behavioral Analysis**: LSTM-based sequential behavior monitoring
- **Heuristic Engines**: Rule-based detection with neural networks

### 2. Adaptive Evolution
- Defense modules evolve in response to successful attacks
- Automatic specialization for specific threat types
- Zero-day detection through novelty scoring
- Population-based evolution for diverse defense strategies

### 3. Threat Intelligence Integration
- Converts threat indicators to graph representations
- Supports STIX-like threat intelligence formats
- Complexity scoring for threat prioritization

## Usage

### Quick Demo

```bash
# Run the cybersecurity demonstration
python scripts/domains/cyber_security/main_cyber_security.py
```

### Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python scripts/domains/cyber_security/test_cyber_security.py --full
```

### Integration Example

```python
from scripts.domains.cyber_security import CyberSecurityGerminalCenter
from scripts.config import Config

# Initialize defense system
cfg = Config()
cfg.population_size = 40
defense_system = CyberSecurityGerminalCenter(cfg)

# Process network traffic
packets = simulate_cyber_attack("ddos", intensity=0.5)
traffic_batch = torch.stack([p.to_tensor() for p in packets])

# Detect threats
results = defense_system.forward(traffic_batch)
threat_score = results['threat_score'].mean()

# Evolve if needed
if threat_score < 0.5:  # Low detection
    defense_system.evolve_defenses(1.0 - threat_score, "ddos")
```

## Attack Simulations

The system includes simulations for various attack types:

1. **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**
   - High-volume traffic from multiple sources
   - Abnormal packet payloads
   - SYN flood patterns

2. **SQL Injection**
   - Embedded SQL patterns in payloads
   - Targeted at web application ports
   - Various injection techniques

3. **Port Scanning**
   - Sequential port access patterns
   - Single source to multiple ports
   - Reconnaissance behavior

4. **Zero-Day Exploits**
   - Novel attack patterns
   - Extreme payload values
   - Temporal anomalies

## Defense Evolution Process

1. **Detection Phase**
   - All defense modules analyze incoming traffic
   - Ensemble integration produces final threat score

2. **Evaluation Phase**
   - System tracks detection success/failure
   - Identifies which attacks are succeeding

3. **Evolution Phase**
   - Tournament selection of best defenders
   - Crossover and mutation to create new defenses
   - Specialization for specific threat types

4. **Adaptation Phase**
   - New defense modules integrated into population
   - Worst performers replaced
   - System memory updated

## Performance Metrics

- **Detection Rate**: Percentage of attacks correctly identified
- **False Positive Rate**: Legitimate traffic flagged as threats
- **Evolution Speed**: Generations needed to adapt to new threats
- **Zero-Day Detection**: Novel threat identification accuracy

## Configuration

Key parameters in `Config`:
- `population_size`: Number of defense modules (default: 64)
- `mutation_rate`: Evolution mutation probability (default: 0.1)
- `batch_size`: Traffic batch processing size (default: 32)

## Output

The system generates:
- Real-time threat scores
- Threat classification results
- Evolution history
- Defense status reports
- Saved checkpoints for trained models

## Future Enhancements

   - PCAP file processing
   - Live network tap support
   - IDS/IPS integration

2. **Advanced Threat Modeling**
   - APT campaign simulation
   - Multi-stage attack detection
   - Lateral movement tracking

3. **Distributed Defense**
   - Multi-node coordination
   - Shared threat intelligence
   - Federated learning

4. **Explainable AI**
   - Attack attribution
   - Defense decision explanations
   - Forensic analysis support
