# Living Therapeutic TE-AI System - Ready for Use

## Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

The living therapeutic system has been successfully debugged and is now ready for real-world medical simulations.

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Tensor dimension mismatches in stem cell differentiation
2. ✅ LSTM output handling for metabolic regulation  
3. ✅ Safety monitor input size compatibility
4. ✅ Therapeutic combination with varying sizes
5. ✅ Method name compatibility (mutate vs _mutate)

## Key Features Working
- **Biosensor Genes**: Detect patient biomarkers and disease states
- **Therapeutic Effector Genes**: Generate treatments for all 5 modes:
  - Anti-inflammatory
  - Immunomodulation  
  - Metabolic regulation
  - Tissue repair
  - Targeted killing
- **Adaptive Controller Genes**: Plan treatment strategies
- **Therapeutic Stem Genes**: Differentiate based on patient needs

## How to Run

### Quick Test (6 hours)
```bash
python therapeutic_standalone.py --patient-type autoimmune --hours 6 --report-interval 3
```

### Full Day Simulation  
```bash
python therapeutic_standalone.py --patient-type autoimmune --hours 24 --report-interval 6 --save-results
```

### Week-Long Treatment
```bash
python therapeutic_standalone.py --patient-type cancer --hours 168 --report-interval 24 --save-results
```

## Disease Types Available
- `autoimmune`: Autoimmune inflammatory diseases
- `cancer`: Cancer with treatment resistance
- `metabolic`: Metabolic syndrome

## What You'll See
- Stem cells differentiating into needed therapeutic types
- Dynamic population evolution based on treatment success
- Realistic disease progression and treatment response
- Adaptive treatment strategies that learn from patient response

The system demonstrates how TE-AI can evolve personalized therapies that adapt in real-time to patient needs - a true test of the architecture's capabilities beyond simple antigen recognition!
